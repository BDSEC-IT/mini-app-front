## Graph Customization

When modifying the dashboard graph, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure a consistent and optimal user experience:

### Spacing and Layout

- The graph should span the full width of its container, with no horizontal padding or margin. This provides an immersive, full-spectrum view of the data.

### Interactivity

- **Crosshair:** Implement a thin, dotted or dashed vertical line that appears when the user hovers over or clicks on the graph. This helps pinpoint specific data points in time.

### Axis Configuration

- **Labels:** To maintain a clean and uncluttered appearance, limit the number of vertical and horizontal axis labels to 4 or 5 steps.

### Component Independence

- **Isolation:** Changes to the dashboard graph component must be self-contained and not impact any other components or pages. Ensure that any modifications are scoped locally to the graph component itself.

## Development Practices

- **Error Checking:** Always double-check for errors after making changes. Ensure that the application builds and runs without any issues.

By following these instructions, we can create a visually appealing and user-friendly graph that enhances the mini-app's dashboard.
